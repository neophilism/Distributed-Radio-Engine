# DRE-19 implementation checkpoint — incomplete

`RecordingChannelRegistry` supplies an actual local-endpoint SQLite constraint on
tenant/application/recording identity. Groove, points and paid reservations share
one primary key; creator/channel/entry identity cannot be reassigned, including
after withdrawal. A separate unique constraint prevents an entry ID from being
retargeted to another recording. Exact replay is idempotent. Transactions use
BEGIN IMMEDIATE, WAL, FULL synchronous commits, bounded contention and a versioned
schema. Private endpoint directories/ordinary files are required; new files use
0600 permissions and memory stores require explicit test opt-in.

Groove publication/withdrawal now requires exact synchronous creator-authorizer
success on a frozen operation and tenant/application/principal scope. Publishing
uses the shared reservation before updating its local view. Caller flags, async
truthy returns and missing authority cannot publish. The callback must establish
actual creator rights; fixture callbacks are not production authorization.

The shared-channel constraint only covers writers using the **same authoritative
database**. Points/paid catalog writer integration is not implemented here yet.
Independent databases do not establish global exclusivity. This is a local
endpoint persistence adapter, not a selected hosted service, at-rest encryption
or E2EE certification. It stores opaque catalog/business metadata, never audio,
keys or protected asset plaintext.

The earlier client-ID-only in-memory `grant` API did not authenticate an issuer or
persist entitlements. It now fails closed. Entitlement reads also report the
missing durable adapter rather than falsely returning an empty entitlement list.
No fixture-grant bypass is exposed. No real grant/entitlement data was migrated
or modified. Existing catalog items remain an ephemeral view; durable active
catalog/withdrawal state, authorized issuer receipts, preserved grant reads and
secure endpoint delivery remain implementation work. The permanent channel
reservation is not an active-publication or entitlement record.

Local `npm run check` passes65 tests and roadmap validation on Node24.19.0,
including11 catalog tests. Actual SQLite tests cover persistence across restart,
two independent connections, paid/points/Groove collision, immutable identities,
scope separation and rollback after a uniqueness violation. Authorization and
fail-closed missing grant behavior are exercised. Current-head CI is separate.

## Resume this unit first

Keep PR25 draft. Resume its actual boardroom/DRE-19 branch and inspect exact-head
CI. Implement durable catalog active/revision state, authenticated rights/issuer
contracts and append-only entitlements with same-decision replay/withdrawal
preservation, then connect all points/paid writers to one authoritative channel
registry. Integrate the approved DRE-05 rights checks and later DRE-23 secure
grant/delivery path. Test concurrency, restart, unauthorized access, withdrawal
and existing entitlement continuity. Do not label this unit complete, invent a
live grant, restore the old client-ID grant API or merge this partial checkpoint.
